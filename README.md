In this fragment of the game location, I implemented several tasks.

1. Moving the player by pressing the LMB (when the player presses the LMB on any part of the location and then the character moves to this place).

2. Implementation of bridge destruction. When the character approaches the bridge, it collapses.

3. Implementation of opening a chest located at the beginning of the location (when the character approaches the chest, it opens).

4. Implementation of the mechanics of picking up a potion - when the player touches a potion (it falls out when opening the chest). The potion disappears, and the character begins to be highlighted along the outline.

5. When the player picks up the potion, he can cross to the other side of the cliff, and the bridge should not be destroyed.

6. Implementation of turning on the torches on the other side of the cliff. When the player crosses the bridge, the torches are lit.
